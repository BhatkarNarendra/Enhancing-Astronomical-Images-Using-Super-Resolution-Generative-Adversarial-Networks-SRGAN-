# Enhancing-Astronomical-Images-Using-Super-Resolution-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-SRGAN-

The SRGAN architecture was developed with an emphasis on improving image resolution while maintaining the integrity of image features. The training of the SRGAN model involved utilizing a blend of adversarial loss and content loss to attain enhanced resolution and superior image quality. 

However due to lack of computational power the accuracy of the images obtained is low.
